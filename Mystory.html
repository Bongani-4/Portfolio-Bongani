            <p>My full names, Bongani Njathu. I was born and raised in a good rural village Modimola, Mafikeng. I grew up in a household with well-mannered Christian parents.2 uncles, mother, younger brother and grandmother. I was a very playful,fun and creative but also stuborn and silly boy.Talented in soccer,drawing and snoocker.This hobbies were my peace of mind and satisfaction to my soul before coding üòÉ
                <p>Later years in my high school I lost my mother then my uncle and my fav close grandmother.Very tough years for someone my age but such is life after all.
                After these losses I had to man up and face life head on at an early age, this is when I accepted the responsibility of changing our home situation for the better. I had to set my dreams and goals very clearly. With passion,hard work, strong motivation for excellence
            I started with my schoolwork because thats the weapon I realised will help me archive my dreams at the moment.üöÄ
        </p>
            Come my matric year, there the was gradual improvement in 
        my marks and perfomance. Then my haversting season began. With 3 distinctions 65% upwards for all my subjects, I got  acepted at North west university and Nelson Mandela university ,NMU offered me a merit bursary and rewards however good offers  from NMU  were I had to go with NWU for personal reasons. 
    </p>
    <p>Now I'm at NWU, I have to keep consistent with my attitude and hard work. Now its 2023, with valuable and memoriable experiences and lessons I managed to completed my Bsc degree with 16 distinctions. Not only academic excellence ,for my career I managed to grow my network with very talented individuals,I got exposure to fundamental tech stack, got involved in big compatitions and hackathons üèÜ.  </p>
            <img src="images/Life-Is-A-Journey.jpg" alt="My Story Image">
            <p>Apart from all I have been through and my circumstances. Its a unique beautifull precious life that has things to be gratefull for. Im proud of my self for not giving up based on my circumstances,for keeping on pushing and chasing growth while enjoying every precious moment.Now I got my degree and I believe my parents where ever they are,my guardian angels, they are proud, but its not the end, big goals are still to be archived. One goal at a timeüéØ. </p>
            <p>I aspire to be a software engineer.I got the skills and knowledge just missing a professional opportunity , in the meantime I keep up with self projects for more practical exposure.
                I got a high priority goal to constant learning,growth and continue to be impactful team member within the industry, fulfilling my passion in innovation and technology.</p>

<p>How I persue this goal, is by joining a good reputation company that cares about innovation, talent of the youth and their growth, where I will also express my desire to contribute to the company and society as a whole.

With this kind of a company I expect tackling and solving realword complex challenges with courageous and professional team and im 100% ready for that,emotionally and mentally.
